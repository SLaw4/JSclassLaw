# Week 13

# what broke and how to fix?
When I ran the code, I noticed the average MPG and trip cost resulted in NaN. My edit button also resulted in an error ('The specified value "undefined" cannot be parsed, or is out of range.'). My delete button seems to be working and I am still able to enter data and submit it. 

# Why not use methods into the class we built? Does the example give a better understanding of implementing classes? 
Writing methods into the class we built can cause us to lose the reference once we save estantiated objects into local storage. If the reference is lost, we can't have the method go and grab that data out right. 
The example has been complex and has introduced many concepts JavaScript I had never heard of before. It's a lot to wrap my head around but with time and practice I think I'll have a better understanding.
