# Decision making process
So for the question of what kinds of decisions I make everyday that I could use as an idea for a CRUD app, I decided to go with what to eat. It's a question that is frequently asked in my household and often nobody has a particularly strong preference for one food over the other. I thought this would be a fun and relatable subject/topic to try and write code for. I'm hoping that I will be able to develop this question so that I can create functions and calculations to make it easier to decide what to eat for dinner (at least on the weekends).

# Decision logic attempt
I updated the code in an attempt to implement more decision logic. I hope that it makes sense.
