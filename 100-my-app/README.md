# Decision making process
So for the question of what kinds of decisions I make everyday that I could use as an idea for a CRUD app, I decided to go with what to eat. It's a question that is frequently asked in my household and often nobody has a particularly strong preference for one food over the other. I thought this would be a fun and relatable subject/topic to try and write code for. I'm hoping that I will be able to develop this question so that I can create functions and calculations to make it easier to decide what to eat for dinner (at least on the weekends).

# Decision logic attempt
I updated the code in an attempt to implement more decision logic. I hope that it makes sense. 

# Decision output render to DOM
So my thinking for this CRUD app would be that the user can set up a goal and habit with a 30 day timeline. Once the user fills out the input fields, the app will render a table or chart/calender that would serve as a log. The user would be able to return to the app to log and track their habits and goals. Edit and delete buttons will be added to provide the user with the ability to modify each table/chart. If a day gets missed, the user would be presented with a motivational quote to try and motivate them to not miss the next day.
