# What is the callback for thing1 and thing2?
I think the callback for thing1 is function thing2 followed by thing3. I'm guessing that the callback for thing2 is thing3?

# Other suggestions for this app?
You could probably add a function that allows the user to create a set and reps list after which they could start and stop the set once they are finished with the exercise. Maybe add countdown timer before the exercise begins.
