# Week 7

# Are you using devTools

Yes I am using devTools. I had only used it before to inspect certain elements in my HTML file but these lectures have taught me so much more on how to better utilize it. It's extremely helpful for understanding what a line of code is doing and how it is being executed as well as for debugging purposes.

# Does the concept of arrays make sense to you?

So I have taken a JavaScript course before that briefly covered arrays. My understanding is that it is basically a tool that stores data into a list. Please correct me if I'm wrong. This is where the content becomes confusing to me especially when loops are added into the mixture. I think providing a real life example of how arrays work would help me better understand its function. I do appreciate that the professor show step by step of what is going on and explaning what is happening. 

# Trouble shooting 

Ok so I played around with the code and was able to get the DOM to update by adding return tripCost to the trackMPGCost function. While working on the code I would backtrack and see where the code stopped working (aka getting input as undefined for the updateDOM function). However I'm not sure if that is the correct way to fix it since when I ran the code at the breakpoint, tripCost still out put 5.40 and not 162. 

# Learning from DevTools

Every lecture video so far has utilized DevTools which I am enjoying. Learning how to use scope and breakpoints is very helpful when troubleshooting and just to see what the code is actually doing. 

# feedback for week 7 (refactor)

For this week's material, I am able to follow along and understand the basics of what the professor is explaining. I can see the practicality of refactoring and modifying the code so it runs more cohesively and logically. However, if I hadn't already been exposed to the concept of loops, arrays and functions, I feel like it would be alot for someone to understand the logic of incorporating a function within a function that also contains a loop. It's a lot of jumping from one area to the next and it's happening kind of quickly for someone to really understand it. Again, if this was the first time someone is being exposed to loops and arrays, I feel like it would be easier to leave the code as it is and build on top of it rather than changing it so drastically. All in all, I am enjoying seeing how varied JavaScript can be written into more practical ways and am looking forward to seeing how to incorporate user input.
