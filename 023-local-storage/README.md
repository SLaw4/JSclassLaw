# JSON
After reading over the MDN article on JSON, my understanding of it is that it's a format for communicating data through the web. It stores values in strings and must be converted/parsed if the data needs to be accessed outside of the web application. The syntax is similar to JavaScript but again it only exists as a string and can be stored as a text file.
