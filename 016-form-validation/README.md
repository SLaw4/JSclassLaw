# Week 8 feedback

# Does the if else statement make sense?

# Yes the basic if else statement does make sense. It follows basic logic. Where I get confused is when arrays are added to it.

# Code challenge (clear text and update DOM with average)

# So I was able to clear the text by adding ERR.textContent = "" to the else statement. And I was able to update the DOM with the average MPG and trip by just calling the function (passing miles, gallons, and price through it) in the else statement.
