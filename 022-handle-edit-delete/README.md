# Week 10 Creating Table with Code

# Populate form input fields 

I know that in order to populate the input fields, we need to grab the data from that specific array and append it to the table row and columns. In terms of how to write the code, I only have a guess as to how it's written. 

# Delete button

So I tried writing various code to get the delete button to work including settting the array length to 0 but that did not work. Then I thought if I could set the table element equal to an empty string. I feel like I'm close but am missing some elements. I also tried using pop and shift and those didn't work either and I'm curious if you are able to use those methods and what I would need to add to the code in order to make it work.
