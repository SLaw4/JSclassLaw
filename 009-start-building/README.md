# Are you using devTools

Yes I am using devTools. I had only used it before to inspect certain elements in my HTML file but these lectures have taught me so much more on how to better utilize it. It's extremely helpful for understanding what a line of code is doing and how it is being executed as well as for debugging purposes.
