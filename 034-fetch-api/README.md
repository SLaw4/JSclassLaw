# Week 16

# Do you run your code using live server? 

Yes I have been running my code using the live server extension. While I am coding along, I make sure to view my code using devTools. I feel that it is important as a learning tool as it helps to better understand the concepts and material. 

# Video notes
-fetch a request and receive a response
-it takes a request object and returns a response object (these objects have their own properties and methods)
-the request object requires more than just a URL, it also needs to know what the method is for the request
-Javascript will automatically set this up for you (unless you need to specify certain properties)
-response object
-recall that fetch is an asychronous operation that returns a promise that resolves into a response object
-api tokens work like a password or signature in order to access certain apis
-GET requests parameters, headers
-error handling 
-POST request
-XmlHttpRequest(XHR)
-HTTP request: a request from a client to a server, from a JavaScript app to a backend API, send and receive requests
-why fetch? native support + docs, no installation required, modern features, modern syntax(Promise)
