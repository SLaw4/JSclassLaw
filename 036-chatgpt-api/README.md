# Week 16 ChatGPT
So after reading over the information on the api website and comparing the notes from the color code video, I attempted to write some code that could be usuable. Because I'm still not familiar on how to read more advanced code, that's kind of where I stopped. After having been prompted by Rio to play around with ChatGPT, I decided to ask it how to create a header object. It gave me some results that I tried incorporating into my code but ultimately it wasn't complete. I think for me, learning how to ask the right or relevant questions is something I need to work more one because in Rio's video she asked the right question that got her to the solution.
