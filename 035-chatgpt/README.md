# Week 16 ChatGPT prompts 
How much logic is involved in coding JavaScript

This was interesing to say the least. I had hesitations going into using ChatGPT and I agree that it's better to embrace it rather than fear it. 
# Thoughts on the interview video
The video answered many of the questions and concerns I had about learning to code. Many of my fears were that what I was learning would become moot or pointless because of how progressive the development of AI has been. It was helpful to hear opinions from all experience levels. Although I still have hesitations, I'm still motivated to continue learning.
