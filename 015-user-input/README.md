# Week 8 feedback

# converting code into modules? 

# I think seeing an example would be cool. Modules can simplify code, making it easier to read.

# code on your own then picking back up with the lecture?

# I do think that coding on our own after doing it along with the lectures helps to put what we learned into practice. 


# Also I had to move around and fix my folders to match yours, just in case you were wondering why there were so many changes in this commit 

# User form validation experience
# So like so many others I have filled out forms online. Many times they'll have a required field that I may not have input for but I cannot submit until that field is filled out. 

# What needs to run when the user hits submit? 
# When the user hits submit, the event listener should take the values from the form and plug them into the appropriate functions.
