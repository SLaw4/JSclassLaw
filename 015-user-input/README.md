# Week 8 feedback

# converting code into modules? 

# I think seeing an example would be cool. Modules can simplify code, making it easier to read.

# code on your own then picking back up with the lecture?

# I do think that coding on our own after doing it along with the lectures helps to put what we learned into practice. 


# Also I had to move around and fix my folders to match yours, just in case you were wondering why there were so many changes in this commit
